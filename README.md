 Galvanize requires an applicant to submit a Portfolio for consideration into their Program. The projects found here were submitted by me originally on Google Drive. In the feedback I received, I was given the challenge of learning Git and uploading files to GitHub for future submissions and projects. This is the result of completing that challenge.
